### SOFIA-Singularities-Of-Feynman-Integrals-Automatized: V1.0.0
This GitHub repository hosts the Mathematica package **“SOFIA: Singularities of Feynman Integrals Automatized”** by Miguel Correia, Mathieu Giroux, and Sebastian Mizera.

The user manual is available at [arXiv:2503.16601](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16601).

To clone the repository locally, simply download the **SOFIA.zip** file. Inside, you will find the notebook SOFIA_examples.nb with several worked-out examples.

Please note that the source files [src,scrj].m do not need to be cloned locally and are instead compiled directly from the GitHub each time Get["SOFIA.m"] is called.

For questions or comments, feel free to email any of the authors or the page maintainer at **mathieu.giroux2@mail.mcgill.ca**.
